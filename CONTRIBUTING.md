## 💬 Community & Communication

We have two main channels for project communication, each serving a specific purpose:

**1. GitHub Issues (Bugs, Features, & Solutions)**
We ask that you use GitHub Issues primarily for bug reports, feature requests, and technical troubleshooting. Keeping these discussions on GitHub is a tremendous help to the community, as it ensures past solutions remain easily searchable for everyone.

**2. Discord (Collaboration, Architecture, & Chat)**
For everything else, join our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/HkAyDy2hWU)! This chat is open to anyone—whether you are a core contributor, wanting to make your first PR, or just a curious soul. It's the perfect place to:
* Ask concrete questions about contributing, code structure, and architecture.
* Coordinate with others on open issues.
* Share laughs and off-topic discussions.

## 🛠️ How to Contribute

When you're ready to submit code, please follow this standard workflow:

1. **Fork** the repository to your own GitHub account.
2. **Clone** the forked repository to your local machine.
3. **Create a new branch** for your contribution: 
   `git checkout -b feature/my-feature`
4. **Make your changes** and ensure they are well-tested.
5. **Stage and commit** your changes with a descriptive message: 
   `git add .`
   `git commit -m "Add new feature: brief description here"`
6. **Push** your changes to your branch: 
   `git push origin feature/my-feature`
7. **Create a Pull Request** against our main repository, providing a clear and detailed description of your changes.

💡 Tip: Don't worry about maintaining a perfectly clean commit history on your branch or force-pushing to tidy things up. We squash merge every PR, so feel free to just keep committing and pushing as you address feedback!
